# README GENERATOR

## Description

I have created a README file generator using Node and the Inquirer package, which gives command line/terminal prompts to a user to enter data and dynamically generate a README file.

## Installation

To use this application, you will need to install Node and the Inquirer package, using the following npm install instruction - npm install inquirer@^8.0.0

## Instructions

To run this README generator application, you will need to go to the Terminal/Command Line and enter node index.js and follow the prompts to enter your data, after which a README file will be generated based on your inputs.
